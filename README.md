# Advent of Code Solutions

Advent of Code is an annual Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

I will be posting my solutions to various years problems.  The structure of the folders will be YEAR/LANGUAGE/DAY/PROBLEM.

Feel free to reach out to me with any comments or tips on my solution implementations, although please keep in mind that these were completed for fun :)
